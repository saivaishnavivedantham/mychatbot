ðŸ¤– Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
ðŸ“… Oct 2024 â€“ Jan 2025
Built a semantic chatbot that answers Python programming questions using vector search and generative models.

ðŸš€ Features
Used PyMuPDF to parse Python textbooks and LangChain for smart document chunking.

Generated dense embeddings using SentenceTransformers; indexed with FAISS for similarity search.

Applied TF-IDF filtering to enhance query-context relevance.

Used DistilGPT-2 via HuggingFace for generative responses.

Deployed with FastAPI, reduced latency by 35% through query and embedding tuning.
